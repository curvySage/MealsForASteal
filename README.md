# Meals for a Steal (CIS 444)

### The Problem

College   students   often   are   stretched   financially   --   with   tuition,   book,   living   and   other   personal   expenses this   can   leave   them   with   little   money   left   over   for   food.   No   one   should   have   to   be   forced   to   eat   Ramen Noodles   every   day   nor   should   they   have   to   be   limited   to   a   meal   variety   based   solely   on   convenience rather   than   taste.   We   want   to   give   those   students   the   option   to   be   able   to   prepare   their   own   homemade meals   that   are   both   delicious    and    affordable!

### Project Purpose
Our   application,   Meals   for   a   Steal,   will   serve   as   a   platform   where   users   may   post   recipes   that   are affordable.   It   will   serve   as   a   convenient   virtual   cookbook   for   those   looking   to   make   a   delicious   and affordable   home   cooked   meal.   This   is   advantageous   over   existing   recipe   sites   because   often   times,   other recipe   sites   do   not   take   price   into   account.

#### Developer's Note:

When using Scout/Scss, select the following for environment:

 * Production (removes comments in css file)
 * Expanded (makes the css easier to read)

When using MAMP or similar Apache Server Application (LAMP, WAMP), consider the following:

 * environment.php contains access to db -- this is different between your local machine and where we are deploying it.
 * Use php version 7.1.8 (same version on deployment environment)
 * Point document root to project folder
 
Once server is setup, initialize your database
 * phpMyAdmin is useful for quickly looking at your local database
 * run the database.sql migragation, which also has some prefilled data
